# PWA Setup Instructions

Your calendar planner app has been converted to a Progressive Web App (PWA)! Here's what has been implemented and what you need to do to complete the setup:

## ✅ What's Already Done

1. **manifest.json** - Created with your app's configuration
2. **service-worker.js** - Basic caching service worker
3. **index.html** - Updated with PWA meta tags and manifest link
4. **main.tsx** - Service worker registration added
5. **SVG Icon** - Created a base icon in `public/icons/icon.svg`

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### 1. Generate PNG Icons

You need to create the actual PNG icon files that the manifest references:

1. Open `http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/public/generate-icons.html` in your browser
2. Click "Generate Icons" to create the preview
3. Click "Download 192x192" and "Download 512x512" to download the PNG files
4. Save the downloaded files as:
   - `public/icons/icon-192.png`
   - `public/icons/icon-512.png`

### 2. Test Your PWA

1. Build and serve your app
2. Open Chrome DevTools
3. Go to the "Application" tab
4. Check "Manifest" and "Service Workers" sections
5. Test the "Install" prompt

### 3. Optional: Customize the Service Worker

The current service worker caches basic files. You may want to add more files to the `urlsToCache` array in `service-worker.js`:

```javascript
const urlsToCache = [
  "/",
  "/index.html", 
  "/manifest.json",
  "/icons/icon-192.png",
  "/icons/icon-512.png",
  // Add your CSS, JS, and other static assets here
];
```

## 🎯 PWA Features

Your app now supports:
- ✅ Install prompt on supported devices
- ✅ Offline functionality (basic caching)
- ✅ App-like experience (standalone mode)
- ✅ Custom theme colors
- ✅ App icons

## 📱 Testing on Mobile

1. Deploy your app to a HTTPS server (required for PWA)
2. Open the app on a mobile device
3. You should see an "Add to Home Screen" prompt
4. The app will install and run like a native app

## 🔍 PWA Checklist

- [x] Service worker implemented
- [x] Meta tags added to HTML
