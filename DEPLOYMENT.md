    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
      
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
      
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./client/dist
```

## üîß Environment Variables

If your app uses environment variables, add them in your deployment platform:

### Vercel
1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Add your variables

### Netlify
1. Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
2. Add your variables

## üì± PWA Testing After Deployment

### 1. Check PWA Features
- Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
- Go to Application tab
- Check Manifest and Service Workers
- Verify icons are loading

### 2. Test Installation
- Look for install prompt in address bar
- Test "Add to Home Screen" on mobile
- Verify app opens in standalone mode

### 3. Test Offline Functionality
- Turn off internet
- Refresh the page
- App should still work (basic features)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Fails**
   - Check Node.js version (18+)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check for TypeScript errors

2. **PWA Not Working**
   - Ensure HTTPS is enabled
   - Check manifest.json is accessible
   - Verify service worker is registered

3. **Icons Not Loading**
   - Generate PNG icons using the tool in `public/generate-icons.html`
   - Place icons in `public/icons/` directory
   - Update manifest.json paths

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check TypeScript errors
npm run check

# Build locally to test
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

Once set up, your app will automatically deploy when you push changes to GitHub:

```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Update app features"
git push origin main

# Deployment happens automatically!
```

## üìä Performance Optimization

After deployment, optimize your PWA:

1. **Lighthouse Audit**
   - Run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
   - Aim for 90+ scores in all categories

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Compress images
   - Use WebP format
   - Implement lazy loading

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Update service worker cache
   - Implement proper cache invalidation

## üéâ Success!

Your Calendar Planner PWA is now live and ready for users to install on their devices!

### Next Steps:
1. Share your app URL with friends and family
2. Test on different devices and browsers
3. Monitor performance and user feedback
4. Add more features and improvements
